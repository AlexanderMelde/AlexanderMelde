### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I love to try out new technologies and explore practical applications.
For example, I have already developed a system for the [recognition of human actions](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/Handlungserkennung) (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) in webcam videos and worked on a [traffic sign recognition](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/Verkehrszeichenerkennung) (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) based on machine learning.

The most experience I have had so far is in the field of web development. However, through my studies and numerous hobby projects I also know a lot about application development (PC & Android) and other new technology trends.

Currently I am deepening my knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence as academic staff in Karlsruhe, Germany. 

Most recently, i published the [SPHAR dataset](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset) (ðŸŒŸ) with over 7000 videos that you can use for action recognition. Just a few months ago, i also published the [YAPF GitHub Action](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/yapf-action) (ðŸŒŸ), which can be used for checking python code formatting.

You can view my full portfolio and my bio at [melde.net](https://melde.net) (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) or follow my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandermelde/) (ðŸŒŸ) profile for updates on hackathons and job activities.
